MonoDevelopGtkSharp3Template
============================

This add-in sets up a project template for creating projects with GTK#3 (must be installed on your system). It sets up a simple starter project for GTK#3 development, which utilises Glade UI to construct the GUI. (The Monodevelop built-in Stetic UI designer is not used, the files must be opened externally in Glade.)
